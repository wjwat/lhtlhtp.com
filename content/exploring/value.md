No matter how thorough or well maintained a project is it will never keep up
with the amount of changes happening on a day to day basis in the wider Internet
ecosystem. **Epicodus**, and Learn How To Program, are both structured to give
you a wide base to stand on, and from which you will be able to explore concepts
at a deeper level. This section will concern itself with some of those things.

## Your Education

The software you write as you learn at **Epicodus** is only the means to the end
of educating yourself and transitioning into a developer role. Ultimately your
goal should be two-fold:

1) Teaching yourself how to teach yourself the concepts you are being introduced
   to at this mad-dash, break neck speed. There are a million details, a thousand
   commands, hundreds of concepts, and only **twenty** weeks to learn. There
   just aren't enough hours in the day to learn everything completely, but there
   is enough time to give yourself the tools that will help you dive a little
   deeper the next time you come across something you only skimmed the surface
   of at **Epicodus**.
2) Make yourself into the kind of person that other people would want to hire!
   This means something a little different for everyone, because no one thing is
   going to work for everyone. If you're able to understand what you enjoy
   most about coding & technology, and can focus in on that, then you can proudly
   say _"This is something I'm passionate about, and I want you to pay me to be
   passionate about it!"_
