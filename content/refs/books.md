### [A Smarter Way To Learn Javascript](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00H1W9I6C&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_5C7NJTNHAJAK9YQQV2J3) by Mark Myers   

This is an excellent book for those still warming up to Javascript. The chapters
cut right to the point of each concept they're exploring in a conversational
tone, and encourage coders to follow along with online exercises they provide. A
fellow Epicodus student has read through the book a few times and still finds
great value in it.

### [A Philosophy Of Software Design](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07N1XLQ7D&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_WD8RZY262E7JB1ZQA0WX) by John Ousterhout

Written by a professor of computer science at Stanford, this one offers a fun
perspective as to what kinds of code are preferred in the coding world
(especially in regards to debugging). While it may not be as useful of a tool
during your time at Epicodus, it invites discussion among other coders (across
all coding languages) as to what makes good code good and preferred programming
styles. This one is a little dense, but a fun read if you're into that sort of
stuff.

### [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftmanship](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B001GSTOAM&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_FT03QDNX75RFMJAN513E) by Robert C Martin

Better known known as "Uncle Bob", Martin explores the difference between good code and bad code: good names, good functions, good objects, good classes and good everything else. Good good good. It's a healthy read to make sure your coding practices are up to speed, and that the code itself can easily be read by others and yourself upon review.

### [Cracking the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Answers (6th Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=Cj0KCQjwio6XBhCMARIsAC0u9aH6br2LJEja6FDRdnTZBM9xTUXUd4qvru_cJ-MbroEpg3Y2S21v_zoaAuncEALw_wcB&hvadid=241871347365&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9033594&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=7986475684502328522&hvtargid=kwd-299613214513&hydadcr=16435_10305567&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview+book&qid=1659127030&sr=8-1) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

Once your attention shifts more into job hunting, Epicodus and its advisors are pretty stellar at conducting mock interviews and providing good feedback. They also have great 'tips and tricks' to acing it from the standpoint of someone that might not be familiar with code. However, whiteboarding (which *actually* is a thing outside of class) and understanding algorithms (some of which are touched on in the [Computer Science](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/computer-science)  portion of Epicodus) is a little lacking. While some of the content is a little more advanced, this book does a pretty good job as to what you might expect going into and during an interview (and how to prepare).
