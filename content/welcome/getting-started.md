Welcome to {{ lhtlhtp() }}, your official companion site to
[LearnHowToProgram.com](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/)

## What To Expect

{{ lhtlhtp() }} does not exist to make you a developer by itself. We are here to
help you in the course of your studies at Epicodus, and hopefully ease the move
into a developer (or developer adjacent) role.

We've broken up the site into many different sections that generally correlate
to the sections you'll find on LearnHowToProgram.com with a focus on those
sections we found needing further exploration or were particularly difficult.

It may seem like a lot to process at first, but as you immerse yourself into the
flow of developing you'll find that reading, and understanding, large volumes of
information comes easier.

## Why (LHT)LHTP.com?

As current Epicodus students we understand how hard it can be transitioning into
a new role in life. Forcing yourself to learn a completely new way of thinking
is difficult no matter what walk of life you're on.

## Who We Are

Current Epicodus students who understand how difficult it can be to try and
transition into a new field. We've been down this path and our hope is to make
it a little easier for those coming behind us.
